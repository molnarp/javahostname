# javahostname

**Prints the local hostname as Java would resolve it on Linux.**

This program simulates how the local hostname is resolved in the OpenJDK Java 8 runtime,
as outlined below.

1. resolve local hostname with gethostname(2)
2. resolve ip address belonging to the hostname you got in step 1 with getaddrinfo(3)
3. resolve canonical hostname for the ip address with getnameinfo(3)

# Installation

```
$ autoreconf --install
```

2. configure and build
```
$ ./configure
$ make
```

3. run program
```
